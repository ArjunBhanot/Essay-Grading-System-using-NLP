# Essay-Grading-System-using-NLP

In this project, our main goal is to make an automated essay grader.

We will use a dataset of essays written by high school students on various types of exam questions. All of them were graded by the instructors. In order to find a relationship in between scores and texts, we will extract average word length etc. We use those features along with the scores to form both a regression and a classification model. When we evaluate them, we see that we can predict the scores with within an acceptable range.
